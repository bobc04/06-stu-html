    <p>
    I'm Robert, a retired US Army Veteran with 25+ years of technical and
    leadership experience within civilian and military organizations. My military experience includes 
    operations with diverse specialized teams in a fast-paced high-performance environment. This includes
    working with various communication systems, intelligence collection, and reporting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently, I'm employed as a Solutions Engineer for a software 
        company and have been in the role for almost four years.
        In this position, I do product demonstrations, training, 
        integrations, and assist with marketing events.    
    <p>

    <p>    
        I'm taking this course because I know coding is a 
        weak area for me. I'm always Googling, StackOverFlow-ing, 
        ChatGPT-ing, asking my boss, etc. If I can code/script 
        more efficiently, it will make my job easier, save time, and ultimately lead
        to fat promotions.
